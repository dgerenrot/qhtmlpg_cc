	USAGE:

	qhtmlpg [OPTIONS] <TagPatternString>

	Quickly specify the structure of your HTML template on the command line.
	The <TagPatternString> determines the nesting of the tags using square
	brackets. 
	
	The correct doctype, html head and title tags are also included.

	For example, if <TagPatternString> is '[]', then the output BODY contains
	a single pair of open/close DIV tags. Some other tags are also supported.
	
	The resulting HTML template is printed to stdout.
	
	For full usage info, specify the -u option.
